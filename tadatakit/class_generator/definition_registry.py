    This class acts as a registry for all schema definitions extracted from a JSON schema, categorizing and organizing

    definitions, the registration of new type hints, and manages multi-inheritance and polymorphism within the schema
    definitions. This class is central to the dynamic creation and management of data models based on the schema
    provided.

    Attributes:

                                       their corresponding Python types.
        _definitions (Dict): A subset of the schema, focusing on the 'components/schemas' section.
        _definition_identities (Dict[str, str]): A dictionary mapping definition names to their identified type category.

        Updates the initialization methods for classes designated as passthrough to directly use their parent's __init__.

        Passthrough classes are meant to act nearly identically to another class, often with very little to no modification
        to the behavior. This method iterates through all passthrough classes, setting their initialization method to
        that of their parent class. It effectively links the child class directly to the parent, ensuring that instances
        of the passthrough class are initialized in the same way as instances of the parent class.

        This approach helps maintain consistency in behavior and ensures correct inheritance and initialization chains
        are preserved for classes that primarily serve as aliases or direct proxies to other classes, while providing
        the more prescriptive class names from the schema.

        Integrates initialization methods from multiple parent classes for classes defined with multi-inheritance.

        This method ensures that classes which inherit from multiple parent classes correctly integrate the initialization
        processes of all their parents. It addresses the challenge of Python's single inheritance constructor chain by
        manually combining the `__init__` methods from each parent class. This ensures that all parent class constructors
        are called and all necessary initializations from each lineage are performed when an instance of a multi-inherited
        class is created.
