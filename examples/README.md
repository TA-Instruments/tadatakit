# TA Data Kit Usage Examples
> [Return to main README](../README.md)

These notebooks provide step-by-step guides for various data analysis and visualization tasks using JSON files generated by TRIOS Software. Whether you are new to the schema or looking to perform complex analyses on Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), rheology, or other data, these examples will help you get started.

## The Basics
1. [Introduction to the Schema](intro_to_the_schema.ipynb)

    This notebook provides a detailed look at the structure and components of the JSON schema used in the tadatakit library. It explains how to read the schema, displays the schema in a formatted manner, and describes the key definitions within the schema.

2. [Plotting Data](plotting.ipynb)

    This example shows how to plot every file from a directory, labeling them by a detail of the procedure. It includes loading all JSON files from a directory, extracting data into Pandas DataFrames, and plotting the data with labels indicating the heating rate.

3. [Format Conversion - XML Example](xml.ipynb)

    This example shows how to convert a TRIOS JSON file to XML, which is useful for applications that require XML format for data interchange or archival. This can act as an example of how one might go about converting to other formats.

## Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
1. [Enthalpy Quantification](enthalpy_calculation.ipynb)

    This example shows how to perform a simple enthalpy calculation on a DSC curve. It includes loading experiment data from a JSON file, defining utility functions to find closest values and integrate the area under a peak, analyzing data to find temperature indices for integration limits, and plotting the results.

2. [Multi-Experiment Kinetics](kinetics.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to perform a kinetics analysis using the Ozawa method on DSC data. It includes loading and organizing data by heating rate, defining functions for data processing, visualizing DSC curves, and calculating activation energy from the Arrhenius plot of Log Heating Rate vs. 1/Peak Temperature.

## Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
1. [TGA Weight Loss](tga_weight_loss.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to perform an analysis of TGA data, leveraging key temperature points to identify weight loss steps and calculate weight fractions. It includes loading experiment data, defining a helper function, identifying key temperature points, and plotting weight and its first derivative.

## Simultaneous DSC/TGA (SDT)
1. [Auto-Analysis of SDT Data](sdt_enthalpy.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to perform an automated analysis of SDT data, leveraging clear weight changes to delineate transitions and quantify the enthalpies of the associated heat flow peaks. It includes loading experiment data, validating internal calculations, identifying weight loss steps through plateau determination, viewing weight regimes overlaid on heat flow, and quantifying enthalpy from heat flow.

## Sorption Analysis (SA)
1. [Hygroscopicity and Surface Area Quantification](sa_wood.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to perform an analysis of sorption analysis performed on a wood sample. It includes loading experiment data, identifying procedure steps, plotting sorption isotherms, fitting the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation, and estimating the surface area of the sample.

## Rheology
1. [Crossover Point Determination](rheology_crossover.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to identify the crossover point from rheology results. It includes loading experiment data, plotting storage and loss moduli against angular frequency, and performing linear interpolation to quantify crossover modulus and frequency.

2. [Yield Stress Determination](rheology_mayo.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to quantify the yield stress of a non-Newtonian fluid (mayonnaise) using a fit to the Herschel-Bulkley model. It includes loading experiment data, plotting shear stress against shear rate, and implementing a gradient descent function for the Herschel-Bulkley model.

## Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
1. [Glass Transition Quantification](dma_tg.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to plot and analyze a DMA experiment to establish the glass transition point from the loss modulus. It includes steps to load experiment data from a JSON file, convert it into a Pandas DataFrame, plot storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta, and quantify the temperature at maximum loss modulus.

## Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA)
1. [Thermal Expansion Coefficient Determination](tma_cte.ipynb)

    This notebook demonstrates how to perform an analysis of TMA data to arrive at a thermal expansion coefficient curve. It includes loading experiment data, defining a smoothing filter, calculating temperature and dimension changes, and plotting the results.
